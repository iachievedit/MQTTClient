# MQTTClient
An Example MQTT Client

Note: This example is on the bleeding edge of Swift 3.0 on Linux.  To get started with Swift 3.0 you can either
pull down the latest DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT from Apple (https://swift.org/download/#snapshots), or obtain Swift 3.0 from
the iAchieved.it (http://dev.iachieved.it/iachievedit/introducing-swift-3-0/).

```
# git clone https://github.com/iachievedit/MQTTClient
# cd MQTTClient
# swift build
# .build/debug/MQTTClient
```
